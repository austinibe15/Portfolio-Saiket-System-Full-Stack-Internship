# Portfolio-Saiket-System-Full-Stack-Internship

#  - Ibe Ezenwa Augustine

Welcome to the Saiket Systems internship project portfolio. This repository contains Task 1 through Task 6, each demonstrating a different facet of full stack development—from static front-end work to database integration and a full stack app. The README provides an overview, setup instructions, and how to view the UI locally using a live server.

# Projects Overview
Task 1: Create a Static Portfolio Website with a Theme

Static portfolio site with homepage, Projects section, and a contact form validated with JavaScript.
Styled with Bootstrap (or Tailwind if you prefer) and designed to be responsive.
Task 2: Create a Responsive Web Page

A landing page skeleton for an e-commerce scenario.
Includes a hero, features, product grid, and a newsletter form with vanilla JS interactions (e.g., dark/light toggle).
Task 3: Front-End Framework Basics

Intro to a front-end framework (React or Angular).
A small to-do application demonstrating add, edit, delete tasks with optional localStorage persistence.
Task 4: [Insert Task Title]

Description and delivery details (to be filled in per actual task).
Task 5: Database Integration

Basics of SQL and integrating a REST API with a database (MySQL or PostgreSQL).
CRUD operations for user data via parameterized SQL queries.
Task 6: Build a Full Stack Application

End-to-end User Management System (CRUD on user profiles) with optional authentication (JWT).
Front-end communicates with a REST API and persists data in a database.
Note: The repository contains links to GitHub for code and live demos as applicable.

Local Setup & Viewing UI
To view the UI locally for any task that includes an HTML/CSS/JS front-end, you can use a simple Live Server. The README assumes you already have a GitHub link for each task, but the instructions below help you run the UI locally and verify visuals.

Practical steps (for any static HTML/CSS/JS task):

Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/saiket-task-portfolio.git
cd saiket-task-portfolio
Open task folders (if separated) and locate index.html

Navigate to: tasks/task-1/index.html (or the root index.html, depending on structure)
Start a Live Server (one of these options)

VS Code Live Server extension: Right-click index.html → Open with Live Server
Use a simple local server (Node.js required)
Install if not present: npm install -g http-server
Run: http-server -p 8080
Open: http://localhost:8080
View the UI

Right-click on index.html in your file explorer and select “Open with Live Server” (or navigate to the served URL provided by your local server).
Optional: Inspect and interact
